# Flowable REST API (generated)

This document summarizes the Flowable REST API that was captured from the running server at http://localhost:32986/flowable-rest/docs and stores references to the generated OpenAPI/Swagger artifacts in this repository.

Files produced during capture (click to open):

- Swagger UI HTML: [`docs/openapi/docs.html`](docs/openapi/docs.html:1)
- Per-module Swagger JSON specs:
  - [`docs/openapi/flowable-swagger-process.json`](docs/openapi/flowable-swagger-process.json:1)
  - [`docs/openapi/flowable-swagger-idm.json`](docs/openapi/flowable-swagger-idm.json:1)
  - [`docs/openapi/flowable-swagger-cmmn.json`](docs/openapi/flowable-swagger-cmmn.json:1)
  - [`docs/openapi/flowable-swagger-eventregistry.json`](docs/openapi/flowable-swagger-eventregistry.json:1)
  - [`docs/openapi/flowable-swagger-app.json`](docs/openapi/flowable-swagger-app.json:1)
  - [`docs/openapi/flowable-swagger-external-worker.json`](docs/openapi/flowable-swagger-external-worker.json:1)
- Local single-file spec bundled in repo: [`docs/openapi/flowable-7.2.0-openapi.yaml`](docs/openapi/flowable-7.2.0-openapi.yaml:1)

Notes about capture

- The Swagger UI HTML was fetched successfully and saved to [`docs/openapi/docs.html`](docs/openapi/docs.html:1).
- Aggregated endpoints such as `/flowable-rest/openapi.json` and `/flowable-rest/v2/api-docs` were either not present or required Basic authentication. Authentication was provided as `rest-admin:test` to fetch some resources.
- When an endpoint returned 401/404 the per-module specfiles referenced from the Swagger UI were fetched instead.

How the repo now contains the API docs

- If you want a single consolidated spec, use the bundled spec [`docs/openapi/flowable-7.2.0-openapi.yaml`](docs/openapi/flowable-7.2.0-openapi.yaml:1) or merge the per-module JSONs listed above.

Quick reference table (examples extracted)

| Method | Path | Summary |
|--------|------|---------|
| POST | /process/form/form-data | Submit task form data | 
| GET  | /history/historic-activity-instances | List historic activity instances |
| GET  | /identity/groups | List groups |
| POST | /identity/users | Create a user |

(These examples are representative; see per-module JSON files for full endpoints and schema definitions.)

How to produce a Markdown API document from the OpenAPI spec

1. Use the bundled YAML: [`docs/openapi/flowable-7.2.0-openapi.yaml`](docs/openapi/flowable-7.2.0-openapi.yaml:1) as the canonical source.
2. To convert YAML -> Markdown automatically you can run a local tool such as `widdershins` or `redocly` locally. Example (run locally):

```bash
# install widdershins (node)
# npm install -g widdershins
widdershins docs/openapi/flowable-7.2.0-openapi.yaml -o docs/openapi/flowable-api.md
```

3. Alternatively, I can merge the per-module JSON specs into a single OpenAPI YAML and generate a Markdown document here if you want — reply with MERGE_AND_GENERATE and I'll create `docs/openapi/flowable-rest-merged.yaml` and `docs/openapi/flowable-api.md`.

Credentials and access

- Some aggregator endpoints require Basic auth. You provided `rest-admin:test` during capture to fetch protected resources. Keep credentials secure.

Next actions (choose one and reply with the exact keyword):

- MERGE_AND_GENERATE — Merge per-module specs and generate `docs/openapi/flowable-api.md` (Markdown) here.
- USE_LOCAL_SPEC — Use the bundled `docs/openapi/flowable-7.2.0-openapi.yaml` and run a converter locally (I will provide exact commands).
- NOTHING — No further action; document saved.
